# Graphing Calculator (Tkinter + SymPy)

**Graphing Calculator** is a Python GUI application built with **Tkinter** and **SymPy**.  
It allows you to evaluate a wide range of mathematical expressions—including calculus, trigonometry, combinatorics, and number theory—and plot 1D and 2D functions. Interactive help with examples and easy-to-use shortcuts make exploring math functions intuitive and fast.

## Features

- **Expression Evaluation**: Arithmetic, trigonometry (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sec`, `cosec`, etc.), calculus (`diff`, `integrate`, `limit`, `Sum`, `Product`), combinatorics (`nCr`, `nPr`, `!`), and number theory (`lcm`, `gcd`, `abs`, `round`, etc.).
- **1D & 2D Plotting**:
  - 1D: `f(x)` functions.
  - 2D: Implicit functions like `x**2 + y**2 - 1` (circle) using contour plots.
- **Constants & Special Functions**: Supports `π`, `e`, `log(a,b)`, `sqrt`, and more.
- **Interactive Help**: Markdown-based help with clickable example buttons.
- **History & Undo**: Keep track of previous inputs and undo mistakes.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts & Quick Buttons**: Built-in buttons for common expressions and operations.
